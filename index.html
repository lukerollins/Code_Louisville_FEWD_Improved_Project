   <p class="about">I'm, for the most part, a self-taught artist. I had photography class in high school. Was briefly mentored by a photographer. Then, I got into stenciling, especially with aerosols. There was quite a bit of praise for hand drawn stencils online, so I decided to learn to draw. I had a class at Preston Art's Center back in 2004. I would say I'm  influenced by street art, manga and/or anime, cartoons, cyberpunk, having eclectic musical tastes, and probably some others, I just can't seem to think of them right now (which is one of many reasons I'm bad at these 'about/bio' thingies). I've shown at The Cinderblock and Day's Espresso. Over the years, my family, especially my parents, have been some of my biggest supporters/patrons.</p>
