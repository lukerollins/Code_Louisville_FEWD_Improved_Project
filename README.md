This is my project for Code Louisville's Front End Web Design. It's just portfolio site for my art. I used jQuery to make the top navigation responsive and JavaScript for the lightbox. Styled via CSS file (of course). I admit, it doesn't have much of my work, but I wanted to make sure it was done on time, since this is my first time making a website.
