# Code_Louisville_FEWD_Improved_Project

This is something closer to how on earth my project may actually look, hence I consider it 'Improved' upon. Also, I have a better idea as to what I'm doing, so that's also an improvement.

The reason the main folder is called 'Round 5' was due to the fact that it's roughly the fifth variation of what my website would look like on my computer. Needless to say I'm starting to understand what's so great about Git and Github; Git, because I can make changes more easily without taking up too much space and Github, because it gives me another place to back up said very vital files.
