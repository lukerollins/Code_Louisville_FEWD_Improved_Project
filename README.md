# A website for Luke Rollins: Famous Artist\*



This is a portfolio site for my art. I used jQuery alone to make the top navigation responsive. I used jQuery plugins for both the lightbox display as well as the arrangement of the thumbnails. Styled via CSS file (of course). I admit, it doesn't have much of my work, but I wanted to make sure it was done right since this is my first time making a website.



\*Maybe not famous now, but in due time...hopefully...
